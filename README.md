The screenshots above may not show it (because I added this later), but the Action Window also has a checkbox called ``Wii Mode``, which is **only meant to be used for files whose integers use the Little Endian byte order**.

If the **Write Action** is chosen, an input dialog will show up, which will apply the changes to either one particular mission or all of them.
## Results
### Example 1
For this example, I chose to **overwrite the files** of Ranking Battle by **editing the CSV contents** generated earlier **by the Read Action**.

![Capture10](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4f71e96f-10b2-454a-875a-85c701312d1a)

I made every mission feature **Future Gohan in both base and Super Saiyan** (159 & 160), as well as have each mission take place in an **invalid map ID** (35) and play **Evolution** (19) in the background.

### Example 2
Here, I overwrote the same file to **make the 5th mission have map destruction enabled** and feature **Supreme Kai as the referee**.

### Example 3
Now, this last example demonstrates best what the **Interpret Action** can do.

It makes the **CSV files** obtained **from the Read Action** much more **readable**.
